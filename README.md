# virtual_board
This Python script utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to create an interactive "Air Canvas" application. Users can draw colorful lines on a virtual canvas using hand gestures captured by a webcam. Additionally, it features line thickness control, color selection, and the ability to import background images for tracing or reference.
